users sign in and have totally random usernames
but make their own password
set your wake up time for when you want to get your note

home page is a table view of all old ones and a header cell that says "reveal today's note!" only if you have one waiting for you.
once you open your note it says "write a note before midnight!"

every day at midnight you must have submitted a note in order to receive one the next morning

appdelegate has a list of all the notes and a list of all the users who submitted a note
have an algorithm to send out the notes randomly to users

*have a chat bot if you really like the notes you've been getting from a person then connect :)
